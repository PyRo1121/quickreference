# Quick Reference

This is a CRUD app with additional useful information and automated tasks to help in day-to-day job activities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- pnpm

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. git clone https://github.com/PyRo1121/quick-reference.git
3. pnpm install

## Usage

There are several scripts defined in `package.json` that help with development:

- `pnpm start`: Starts the application using `node index.js`.
- `pnpm run dev`: Starts the development server using Vite.
- `pnpm run lint`: Lints the source files using ESLint and automatically fixes any fixable issues.
- `pnpm run build`: Builds the application for production using Vite.
- `pnpm run serve`: Serves the built application for previewing the production build.
- `pnpm run format`: Formats the source files using Prettier.
- `pnpm run todo`: Runs a custom script (`scrape-todos.js`) that presumably scrapes TODO comments from the code.
- `pnpm run clean`: Deletes the `dist` and `node_modules` directories and prunes the ppnpm store.
